[ ] - build library to fetch the selectors
[x] - build somethign to fetch verified bytecodes
[ ] - and something to verify addresses.
[x] - add green, yellow, red marks - similar concept to rust warnings.
[x] - somehow, get the other contract bytecode hashes too (maybe separate repo for now??)
[x] - figure out all those unknown addresses.


[ ] - verify the addresses - check bytecodes, and if proxies - then check where are they pointing.
