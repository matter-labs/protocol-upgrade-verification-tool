# Governance upgrade CLI tool

Tool to analyze the zkSync upgrades.

First, you need to get the gateway_ecosystem_upgrade_output.yaml file.
(you can find it in contracts/l1-contracts/upgrade-envs/outputs )

## Example use:

To conduct the full verification, you need to provide:
- `ecosystem-yaml`, the path to the output file.
- `l1-rpc`, the JSON RPC client for Layer 1. 
- `era-chain-id`, the chain id of the zkSync Era.
- `bridgheub-address`, the address of the bridgehub in the ecosystem.
- `contracts-commit`/`era-commit` (optional), the commits of `era-contracts` and `zksync-era` server to base the verification on. If not provided, a sensible default value will be used.
- `testnet-contract`, (optional, FOR TESTNETS ONLY), if provided, it will assume that testnet verifier should be used. 

```
cargo run -- --ecosystem-yaml data/gateway_ecosystem_upgrade_output.yaml --l1-rpc http://localhost:8545 --contracts-commit 0xa80a24beb7cfe97387bcc9359ad023a4b5b56943 --era-commit 0x99c3905a9e92416e76d37b0858da7f6c7e123e0b --era-chain-id 270 --testnet-contracts  --bridgehub-address 0xb244E9B485fc872e3242960b786dB5189f6A6d2A
```

### Mainnet verification

```
cargo run -- --ecosystem-yaml data/gateway_ecosystem_upgrade_output_mainnet.yaml --l1-rpc <your-l1-rpc> --contracts-commit 0xa80a24beb7cfe97387bcc9359ad023a4b5b56943 --era-commit 0x99c3905a9e92416e76d37b0858da7f6c7e123e0b  --era-chain-id 324 --bridgehub-address 0x303a465B659cBB0ab36eE643eA362c509EEb5213
```

## Abilities and limitations of the tool

This tool will check that:
- The deployed contracts contain the bytecode that is in line with the hashes stored in the era-contracts repo. It is assumed that it is the job of the CI to maintain the correct hashes. If a verifier does not trust the CI, they rebuild the contracts and verify the correctness of the hashes.
- The genesis params are aligned with the ones in the `zksync-era` repo. The same CI protection as with the contracts' hashes is applied here.
- The calldata of the inner calls, chain creation params, etc are correct and consistent with the output file provided.

### Checks for contracts that are deployed with temporary initial owners

Some contracts are initially deployed with a temporary initial owner (to facilitate easier initialization) and then the ownership is granted to the governance. Note, that this tool only checks that the ownership has been transferred as well as that the final state of the contract (e.g. ownership, etc) are correct. 

It does not check whether any malicious activity has been done during the initialization of the contracts. Thus, it is desirable to cross check via using an explorer (e.g. Etherscan) that no additional malicious activity was done before the transfer of the ownership. 

In case of the v26 upgrade, the above applies to the following contracts:
- `ValidatorTimelock` (`validator_timelock_addr`)
- `L1AssetRouter` (`shared_bridge_proxy_addr`)
- `L1NativeTokenVault` (`native_token_vault_addr`)
- `RollupDAManager` (`l1_rollup_da_manager`)
